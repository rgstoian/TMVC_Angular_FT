# Sample automated test suite for an AngularJS-based web application using Python and Selenium

## Description
This is a sample automated test suite for a to-do list web application built with AngularJS, which can be found at: http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/#/
The test cases are written in Python on a Windows 10 system using JetBrains PyCharm, following a BDD Cucumber format.
### Requirements
-	Python 3.7
	-	behave
	-	selenium
	-	page-objects (used due to it providing easy bindings for page objects and locators)
-	Chrome or Firefox with their respective driver paths added to the OS PATH variable
### Notes
-	Python 3.7 is used to ensure maximum compatibility.
-	The project is using its own virtual environment to reduce bloat, with a requirements.txt generated by pip.
-	The page-objects package was used to simplify Page Object generation

## Test Cases

-  **Scenario**: Check Default interface
    >**Given** the app is open
    **Then** The title is visible
    **And** The new todo item field is visible
    **And** The footer is visible
    **And** A single list is visible


-  **Scenario Outline**: Add a new ToDo item
    >**Given** the app is open
    **When** I input: \<task> in the new todo item field
    **And** Press the Enter Key
    **Then** The \<task> is created as a to-do item
    **And** The remaining task counter increases

		  Task Examples:
	      | Delete Facebook |
	      | Lawyer Up       |
	      | Hit the Gym     |
	      | Stay in School  |
	      | Eat your Greens |


-  **Scenario Outline**: Mark an item as done
	  >  **Given** the app is open
    **When** I mark the task: "\<tasktocheck>" as done via its checkbox
    **Then** The task: "\<tasktocheck>" is marked as done
    **And** The task: "\<tasktocheck>" becomes grey and crossed-through
    **And** The remaining task counter decreases

		   Examples:
		  | Lawyer Up   |
	      | Hit the Gym |
